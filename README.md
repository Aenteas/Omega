### Game rules
Omega was born as an experiment on complexity and intuitive arithmetic, making a cross between Hex and Go. The game is played by
2 or more players, each trying to create groups of their colors by placing stones in a hexagonal grid, in order to score the most points. But each player places stones of all colors in each turn. The scores for each player is calculated by multiplying the sizes of disconnected groups of the respective colors.
